n this project we developed a complete back end software in which we can update the stock, modify stock, we can forecast the stock, generate invoice.
From this application we can get an update that if a particular inventory or stock is less than the some pre-fixed quantity then it will be easy for the manager/owner to reorder the product from supplier to overcome the Out of Stock stage.
In addition to this it can also help us to manage the warehouses, add warehouses which can be proved as very useful feature.
We can have complete customer details which can help us to retrieve the
order details of regular customers.
From this program we can also keep a track of transactions performed by
different customers/clients. We can also get an idea that how much fund we received from different payment methodologies.
